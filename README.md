# AgeDOBCalculator

The *AgeDOBCalculator* is a simple Java program that allows you to calculate either the *age* based on a given *Date of Birth (DOB)* and a *reference date, or calculate a person's **DOB* based on their *age* and a reference date. This is a useful utility for anyone who needs to easily work with birth dates and ages in a simple text-based interface.

## Features

- *Calculate Age from DOB: Given a **DOB* and a *reference date*, the program will calculate the exact age (in years, months, and days).
- *Calculate DOB from Age: Given an **age* and a *reference date, the program will calculate the corresponding **DOB*.
- The program uses the format DD-MM-YYYY for dates.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the AgeDOBCalculator.java file.
2. Compile the program using the following command:
    bash
    javac AgeDOBCalculator.java
    
3. Run the program with:
    bash
    java AgeDOBCalculator
    

### Example 1: Calculate Age from DOB

plaintext
Enter DOB or AGE (e.g., DOB=06-03-2005 or AGE=19):
DOB=06-03-2005
Enter the reference date (e.g., 22-10-2024):
22-10-2024


## How It Works

- The user can input either a *Date of Birth (DOB)* or an *Age*.
- If the input starts with DOB=, the program calculates the *age* using the provided *DOB* and *reference date*.
- If the input starts with AGE=, the program calculates the *DOB* based on the given *age* and *reference date*.
- The program works by splitting the provided dates using the - delimiter and converting them into integers for comparison. It then calculates the difference between the given dates (for *age* calculation) or adjusts the given *age* to compute the *DOB*.

## Requirements

- *Java 8* or higher (for compiling and running the program).
- A *terminal* or *command line interface* to run the program.
